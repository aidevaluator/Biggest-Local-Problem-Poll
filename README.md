# Biggest-Local-Problem-Poll
I would like a Drupal poll where (preferably local people) can suggest problems and vote on the top 3 sugestions. New suggestions featured below. Topic pages are divided into those for users and those for donors. I would like only users of aid to vote and then then only the result should be visible on the donor/general info pages. The importance let local people decide, which are their top local problems, to let local homeless people decide which are ther top problems and to allow the general public to see, what locals and users rate as their main impediments.
